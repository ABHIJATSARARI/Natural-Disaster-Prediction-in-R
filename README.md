# Natural-Disaster-Prediction-in-R


[!Project Logo](https://github.com/ABHIJATSARARI/Natural-Disaster-Prediction-in-R/blob/main/logo.png)


## Overview
This project leverages an earthquake dataset from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to predict natural disasters. The application features a GUI that allows users to interact with the model and observe immediate outcomes. The `shiny` package in R is used to develop a straightforward web application, resulting in an interactive web application for earthquake prediction.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: Engage with the model and observe predictions in real-time.
- **USGS Earthquake Dataset**: Utilizes comprehensive earthquake data for accurate predictions.
- **Shiny Package**: Develops a user-friendly web application in R.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/natural-disaster-prediction.git
    cd natural-disaster-prediction
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the Shiny app:
    ```R
    library(shiny)
    runApp("app.R")
    ```
2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3838`.

## Dataset
The earthquake dataset is sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

## Live Demo
